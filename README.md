 of time

## Description
This package is a wrapper for [psaw](https://github.com/dmarx/psaw). It allows
the user to easily count the number of a certain regex pattern within a
subreddit. The regex matches are outputted to a dictionary, with the words
themselves being the keys, and the number of occurrences as the values.
